This final project consists of 2 Parts. 

[**Part 1:**](/docs/part1.md) consists of a 3D multi-XPUs diffusion solver. A steady state solution of a diffusive process for given physical time steps using the pseudo-transient acceleration (using the so-called "dual-time" method).

[**Part 2:**](/docs/part2.md) covers the 3D elastic wave propagation problem.
